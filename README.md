R-squared explains to what extent the variance of one variable explains the variance of the second variable. So, if the R2 of a model is 0.50, then approximately half of the observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs.


heteroskedasticity (or heteroscedasticity) happens when the standard errors of a variable, monitored over a specific amount of time, are non-constant
