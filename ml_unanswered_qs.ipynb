    "What are the assumptions required for linear regression?,\"There are four major assumptions: 1. There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the regressors, meaning the model you are creating actually fits the data, 2. The errors or residuals of the data are normally distributed and independent from each other, 3. There is minimal multicollinearity between explanatory variables, and 4. Homoscedasticity.

    "\"What is linear regression? What do the terms p-value, coefficient, and r-squared value mean? What is the significance of each of these components?\",\"A linear regression is a good tool for quick predictive analysis: for example, the price of a house depends on a myriad of factors, such as its size or its location. In order to see the relationship between these variables, we need to build a linear regression, which predicts the line of best fit between them and can help conclude whether or not these two factors have a positive or negative relationship\",springboard,,\n",

    "\"In Python, how is memory managed?\",,springboard,,\n",
    "\"In Python, memory is managed in a private heap space. This means that all the objects and data structures will be located in a private heap. However, the programmer won’t be allowed to access this heap. Instead, the Python interpreter will handle it. At the same time, the core API will enable access to some Python tools for the programmer to start coding.

There are many changes happening in your business every day, and often you will want to understand exactly what is driving a given change — especially if it is unexpected. Understanding the underlying causes of change is known as root cause analysis.\",springboard,,\n",
    "What are hash table collisions?,\"If the range of key values is larger than the size of our hash table, which is usually always the case, then we must account for the possibility that two different records with two different keys can hash to the same table index. There are a few different ways to resolve this issue. In hash table vernacular, this solution implemented is referred to as collision resolution.\",springboard,,\n",
    "What is an exact test?,\"In statistics, an exact (significance) test is a test where all assumptions, upon which the derivation of the distribution of the test statistic is based, are met as opposed to an approximate test (in which the approximation may be made as close as desired by making the sample size big enough). This will result in a significance test that will have a false rejection rate always equal to the significance level of the test. For example an exact test at significance level 5% will in the long run reject true null hypotheses exactly 5% of the time.\",springboard,,\n",

In addition, we can use calculate VIF (variance inflation factor) to check the presence of multicollinearity.

Every time they fall down, they learn (unconsciously) & realize that their legs should be straight and not in a bend position. The next time they fall down, they feel pain. They cry. But, they learn ‘not to stand like that again’. In order to avoid that pain, they try harder. To succeed, they even seek support from the door or wall or anything near them, which helps them stand firm.\n",

    "This is how a machine works & develops intuition from its environment.\",analyticsvidhya,,\n",
    " I know that a linear regression model is generally evaluated using Adjusted R² or F value. How would you evaluate a logistic regression model?,\"We can use the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since logistic regression is used to predict probabilities, we can use AUC-ROC curve along with confusion matrix to determine its performance.\n",
    "Also, the analogous metric of adjusted R² in logistic regression is AIC. AIC is the measure of fit which penalizes model for the number of model coefficients. Therefore, we always prefer model with minimum AIC value.\n",
    "Null Deviance indicates the response predicted by a model with nothing but an intercept. Lower the value, better the model. Residual deviance indicates the response predicted by a model on adding independent variables. Lower the value, better the model.\",analyticsvidhya,,\n",
    "\"Considering the long list of machine learning algorithm, given a data set, how do you decide which one to use?\",\"You should say, the choice of machine learning algorithm solely depends of the type of data. If you are given a data set which is exhibits linearity, then linear regression would be the best algorithm to use. If you given to work on images, audios, then neural network would help you to build a robust model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data comprises of non linear interactions, then a boosting or bagging algorithm should be the choice. If the business requirement is to build a model which can be deployed, then we’ll use regression or a decision tree model (easy to interpret and explain) instead of black box algorithms like SVM, GBM etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, there is no one master algorithm for all situations. We must be scrupulous enough to understand which algorithm to use.\",analyticsvidhya,,\n",
    "Do you suggest that treating a categorical variable as continuous variable would result in a better predictive model?,\"For better predictions, categorical variable can be considered as a continuous variable only when the variable is ordinal in nature.\",analyticsvidhya,,\n",
    "When does regularization becomes necessary in Machine Learning?,\"Regularization becomes necessary when the model begins to ovefit / underfit. This technique introduces a cost term for bringing in more features with the objective function. Hence, it tries to push the coefficients for many variables to zero and hence reduce cost term. This helps to reduce model complexity so that the model can become better at predicting (generalizing).\",analyticsvidhya,,\n",
    "What do you understand by Bias Variance trade off?,\"The error emerging from any model can be broken down into three components mathematically. Following are these component :\n",
    "\n",
    "error of a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias error is useful to quantify how much on an average are the predicted values different from the actual value. A high bias error means we have a under-performing model which keeps on missing important trends. Variance on the other side quantifies how are the prediction made on same observation different from each other. A high variance model will over-fit on your training population and perform badly on any observation beyond training."
